# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:**  
Understand data using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

**Tools Used:**  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed
1. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, distribution).  
2. Visualized numeric features with histograms & boxplots.  
3. Used correlation matrix & pairplots to identify relationships.  
4. Detected patterns, anomalies, and trends in the dataset.  
5. Made feature-level inferences from visuals (e.g., survival patterns by age, class, sex).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Titanic Dataset** (same as Task 1).

## âœ… Key Learnings
- How to extract insights using statistics.  
- How to visualize data distributions.  
- How to spot correlations and patterns.  
- How EDA shapes ML feature engineering decisions.
